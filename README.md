* Ehret, Katharina, Alice Blumenthal-Dram√©, Christian Bentz and Aleksandrs Berdicevskis (submitted). "Meaning and measures: Interpreting and evaluating the meaning of complexity metrics." 

The publication links research on corpus linguistics, language typology and cognitive linguistics research, and specifically contributes to the sociolinguistic-typological debate on language complexity. This debate has to a very large extent been motivated by the question of whether all languages are equally complex, and if not, which language-external parameters affect the distribution of complexity across languages. To address this and other questions, a panoply of different metrics and approaches has been put forward to measure the complexity of languages and language varieties. Against this backdrop the publication addresses three major gaps in the literature by discussing statistical, theoretical and methodological problems related to the interpretation of complexity measures.


### Overview and description of folders and files

#### Folders

##### Figures

A folder with all figures from the three case studies described in the related publication. Figures are available in pdf and eps format.

##### Tables

A folder comprising three csv files with general descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the data presented in the three case studies. 

#### Files 

##### BrownianMotion_simulation.Rmd

R code and instructions for data generation, figures, and analysis presented case study 1 with Brownian motion.

##### IWMLC_SimulationStudy.Rmd

R code and instructions for data generation, figures, and analysis presented in case study 2, a simulation including one location shift.

##### Kolmogorov_Metaanalyses.Rmd

R code and instructions for the figures and analysis presented in case study 3 on Kolmogorov-based morphological complexity across ten languages. 

##### semialice_morphratios.csv

Kolmogorov-based morphological complexity ratios for ten languages of *Alice's adventures in Wonderland*. This is a subset of the data presented and described in [Ehret & Szmrecsanyi (2016)](http://www.benszm.net/omnibuslit/Ehret_Szmrecsanyi_2016_proofs.pdf).
